isBIM Privacy Policy
Last Modified: November 27, 2025
Introduction
isBIM Limited respects the privacy rights of users and recognizes the importance of protecting information collected about you. This Privacy Policy applies to our corporate website, the JARVIS AI Suite (including JARVIS Agent, Pay, Air, Eagle Eye, SSSS, DWSS, CDCP, and Assets), and our mobile applications.
By continuing to use our Website, JARVIS platforms, Mobile Apps, and services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the terms set out in this Privacy Policy.
1. Scope & Definitions
Applicability
This policy covers all digital touchpoints within the isBIM ecosystem, including but not limited to:
• The isBIM Corporate Website;
• JARVIS AI Suite Products: Agent, Pay, Air, Eagle Eye, SSSS (Smart Site Safety System), DWSS (Digital Works Supervision System), CDCP (Common Data Collaboration Platform), and Assets;
• Mobile Applications: Including "Xinqiao East AR Inspection", "Jarvis iSuper", and other JARVIS companion apps;
• BIM Consultancy and Project Management (JPM) services.
Roles
isBIM acts as both a Data Controller (for website visitors and direct clients) and a Data Processor (when processing data on behalf of Customers using JARVIS products, such as contractor employment data in DWSS or biometric data in SSSS).
2. Data Collected
We collect different types of data depending on the products you use:
• Account & Professional Info: Name, email, job title, employer details, and credentials provided when registering for JARVIS DWSS, CDCP, or Agent.
• Device & Location Data: Device model, OS version, and coarse location data used to support construction site positioning in our AR and SSSS apps.
• Safety & Biometric Data: For users of our Smart Site Safety System (SSSS), we may process data from wearables (e.g., heart rate, fatigue levels) strictly for mandated safety compliance.
• Visual & IoT Data: 360° site captures, video feeds, and IoT sensor readings collected via JARVIS Eagle Eye and Assets for digital twin creation.
3. Augmented Reality (AR) & TrueDepth API
Important Notice for Users of isBIM AR Applications (including JARVIS Eagle Eye & AR Inspection Apps):
Our applications may utilize Apple's TrueDepth Camera technology to provide centimeter-level precise spatial positioning and AR experiences. This technology captures environmental depth information to achieve precise spatial mapping (e.g., overlaying BIM models onto physical construction sites).
• No Cloud Storage: All biometric data and depth information captured by TrueDepth are processed temporarily and locally on your device.
• No Transmission: This data is never stored, transmitted, or uploaded to isBIM servers or any third-party servers.
• Immediate Clearance: Depth data is cleared from memory immediately after the application session closes. We do not have access to your facial recognition data or depth images.
• Purpose: This technology is used solely for the real-time positioning of BIM models and AR visualization to improve construction quality and efficiency.
4. Purpose of Processing
We use your data for the following specific purposes:
• Service Provision: To operate JARVIS modules (e.g., processing invoices in Agent, visualizing twins in Eagle Eye).
• AR Spatial Mapping: To provide accurate overlay of digital models on physical sites using device sensors.
• Safety & Compliance: To monitor site safety, prevent accidents, and generate mandatory reports (e.g., RISC forms, site diaries) as required by the Development Bureau (DEVB) and SOPL regulations.
• AI Model Improvement: To train and refine our AI algorithms using de-identified, aggregated data.
• Support: To handle inspection tickets and issue reports submitted by you.
5. AI & Automated Processing
The JARVIS AI Suite utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to provide services such as automated tender scoring, safety hazard detection, and generative design.
Your Interaction & Training: We may use user interactions and feedback to fine-tune our models. However, this is done using aggregated, anonymized data that does not identify individual users or compromise specific confidential project proprietary data unless explicitly authorized.
6. Sharing & Disclosure of Data
We may share data with:
• Service Providers: Cloud hosting (e.g., Alibaba), AI computation providers, and data storage partners.
• Project Stakeholders: In the context of JARVIS CDCP or DWSS, data is shared with relevant project owners, contractors, and consultants.
• Regulatory Bodies: When required to submit safety or compliance reports via JARVIS DWSS or SSSS.
• User Generated Content: Inspection tickets or site photos you upload may be visible to your specific project team members.
7. Your Rights
You have certain data protection rights:
• Access & Rectification: Access your personal data held in our systems (including JARVIS profiles) and correct inaccuracies.
• Object & Erasure: Request deletion of personal data, subject to data retention laws mandated for construction projects.
• Withdraw Consent: You can withdraw consent for camera or location access at any time via your device settings. This may limit AR functionalities.
8. Security
We employ enterprise-grade security measures, including encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control (RBAC), and regular security audits.
• AR Data Security: TrueDepth/Depth data is processed only in local volatile memory.
• Transmission Security: All inspection tickets and project data use end-to-end encryption.
9. Retention of Personal Data
Data retention is often dictated by construction contracts and legislation (e.g., keeping safety records for a specific number of years). We retain project data for the duration of the agreement and as required by laws (such as the Limitation Ordinance).
AR Data: TrueDepth generated temporary data is cleared immediately after the app session ends.
10. Cookies Policy
We use cookies to enhance the functionality of our web-based platforms (JARVIS) and for analytics purposes. By using our Services, you consent to the use of cookies.
11. Contact & Other Conditions
Children's Privacy: Our applications are designed for construction professionals and are not directed to children under 13.
