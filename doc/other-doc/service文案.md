**Project Finance**

**We make emerging-market infrastructure bankable — live JARVIS data + global capital = financial close.**

**The Emerging-Market Financing Gap**

Most global investors shy away from infrastructure in emerging economies. Non-commercial risk, opaque cost trajectories, payment delays, and lack of verifiable progress data create a wall of uncertainty that keeps private equity, private credit, and even some DFIs on the sidelines. Billions of dollars of viable projects — data centres, renewable power plants, hospitals, smart cities — stay stranded because sponsors cannot deliver the real-time transparency lenders demand.

**Our Capital Network: From PE Funds to Multilateral Institutions**

We sit at the centre of a wide, active network of global infrastructure investors: leading private equity and private credit funds, development finance institutions, multilateral banks, export-credit agencies, and green/sovereign investors. Because every project we finance is already running on JARVIS and JPM, we can deliver live digital twins, audited cost curves, and 30-day-ahead risk forecasts — giving lenders the certainty they need to deploy capital at scale and at competitive pricing.

**In-Kind Investment Before a Dollar Is Committed**

We de-risk projects long before financial close. Using live JARVIS data, we fund and deliver bankable feasibility studies, detailed financial modelling, ESG structuring, and credit-enhancement design — all at our risk. This front-loaded, in-kind investment turns conceptual pipelines into fully packaged, investor-ready transactions, dramatically shortening the path from mandate to first disbursement.

**JARVIS Ventures**

**We back, build, and globalise the best construction technology founders – hardware, software, anywhere on earth.**

**20 Years of Playbook: We Scale with Battle-Tested Distribution**

We partner with the sharpest construction-AI founders and give them what most VCs can’t: instant commercial traction. With 2,600 live projects, 1.2 billion ft² of built assets, an 8,000+ China MiC supplier network, and government-level relationships across the globe, we turn prototypes into revenue in months, not years. Our two decades of domain expertise and live JARVIS data become your unfair advantage.

**Conviction-Led Investment Across the Stack**

We provide first institutional capital to exceptional teams re-engineering construction from the ground up — vertical AI agents, robotics, modular systems, digital twins, ESG tech, and everything in between. Geography-agnostic at the earliest inflection points. Our conviction is simple: the winners will be those who fuse deep domain physics with frontier intelligence. We back them before anyone else sees it, then accelerate product-market fit inside our own global pipeline.

**Your Fastest Route to the World’s Biggest Construction Pipelines**

We open doors to the defining infrastructure projects of our time: AI-ready data centers across Southeast Asia, hundreds of thousands of new residential units in emerging African capitals, renewable power plants and transmission grids, smart cities, hospitals, and ports that form the backbone of the global economy. From first pilot in Hong Kong to multi-country revenue in months — backed by on-the-ground teams in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. No cold outreach. No market entry friction. Just scale.

**BIM Consultancy**

**Mandated digital transformation: Model, coordinate, and comply with HK's BIM standards—reduce rework by 75%, accelerate delivery.**

**Mandated by DEVB: ContractBIM Compliance for Capital Works**

Hong Kong’s BIM journey started with Technical Circular (Works) No. 7/2017 (effective 1 Jan 2018) requiring BIM on all major public works over HK$30M. The scope has steadily expanded: 4D/5D added in 2018, investigation and feasibility stages in 2020, asset management in 2020, Common Data Environment in 2021, and now TC(W) No. 1/2025 makes BIM models contractually binding in tenders under the HKIS BIM Contract Conditions. isBIM has been there every step — delivering certified, compliant BIM for 2,600+ projects since day one.

**Benefits: Collaboration, Efficiency, and Risk Reduction**

A single 3D digital twin replaces hundreds of conflicting 2D drawings. Clash detection before construction cuts rework by up to 75%. Automated quantity take-offs and 5D costing reduce budget overruns by 72%. 4D scheduling shortens timelines by 30–45%. Everyone — architect, engineer, contractor, client — works on the same live model, so there are no more “which drawing is correct?” arguments.

**What We Actually Deliver**

- **Full BIM Modelling**(LOD 300–500, Revit/IFC, clash-free coordination)
- **On-site Secondment**of CIC/BSI-certified BIM Managers & Coordinators
- **End-to-End Consultancy**(BEP creation, CDE setup, ISO 19650 audits)
- **Tendering Support**(BIM-embedded BOQs, 5D cost models, ContractBIM compliance) Multiple CIC Gold & Silver Service Awards and 1.2 billion ft² of proven assets — from HKIA expansions to M+ Museum — mean your project meets every mandate and finishes faster and cheaper.

**JARVIS Project Management (JPM)**

**Building the backbone of emerging economies**—**cheaper, faster, fewer defects.**

**Hong Kong Precision Meets China Scale: The Four-Pillar Engine**

JPM fuses Hong Kong Professional Services (bilingual PM teams translating global/HK standards into China-executable specs, dual compliance expertise), AI Intelligence (real-time digital twin predicting risks 30 days ahead at 89% accuracy, 3-minute executive dashboards), 8,000+ vetted MiC suppliers (4-step matching: technical, experience, financial, cultural), and Global Delivery (end-to-end from design to after-sales, 35–45% less waste, 25–35% lower emissions). This is nation-scale infrastructure orchestration—Hong Kong’s strategic bridge to Belt & Road.

**By the Numbers: Core Value Creation**

Traditional models fail: 68% budget overruns, 18% defect rates, 36-month cash cycles. JPM delivers:

- Total Project Cost: 70–80% (20–30% savings)
- Delivery Time: 55–70% (30–45% faster)
- Quality Defects: 5% (71% reduction)
- Budget Overruns: 19% (72% reduction)
- Cash Conversion: 24 months (33% shorter)

**The Backbone of Emerging Economies: Africa 2025**

In September 2025, JPM signed HKD 13B+ in Africa:

- Cameroon National Engineering Initiative (Presidential approval): 28,000-unit City of Great Achievement + South Province Government HQ (HKD 760M)
- Nigeria Abuja Smart City (MoU with Ministry of Housing): 143-hectare luxury complex, Speaker + 13 Governors engaged (HKD 500M) JPM exports Hong Kong standards, China’s MiC scale, and AI foresight—transforming development finance into secure, efficient, bankable national infrastructure for the next century.
