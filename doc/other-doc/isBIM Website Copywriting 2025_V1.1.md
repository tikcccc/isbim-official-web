About Us

Why We’re Here

isBIM is accelerating the global infrastructure build-out by driving digital transformation in the construction industry through a hybrid “Consulting + AI Products” model. We fuse world-class engineering execution, frontier generative AI, and modular construction into a single platform—live across 2,600 AI factories, data centers, power plants, stadiums, and hospitals spanning 1.2 billion ft². Decades of proprietary engineering data converge in JARVIS, the industry’s first generative AI agent that accelerates every phase: from generative design and automated tendering to payment certification, site safety, and facility operations—delivering projects faster, cheaper, safer, and greener.

JARVIS Project Management (JPM) integrates Hong Kong’s renowned professional expertise with AI-driven foresight, China’s Modular Integrated Construction (MiC) ecosystem, and a global hyperscaler network to power critical infrastructure in emerging economies. Backed by Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund (via Gobi Partners AEF GBA), MTR Lab (HKEX: 0066), and C Cheng Holdings (HKEX: 1486), we are evolving from Hong Kong contech leader to global infrastructure powerhouse—with JARVIS AI Suite, fine-tuned on our domain data and powered by Alibaba, serving owners, consultants, contractors, and quantity surveyors end-to-end.

What We Do

**We deliver a verticalized AI copilot for every player in construction.**

JARVIS is the industry’s first full-stack generative AI suite, serving owners, consultants, contractors, quantity surveyors, and facility managers end-to-end. From JARVIS Agent (99.8% accurate invoice/tender automation in EN/ZH) to JARVIS Air (500K+ generative design templates in seconds), JARVIS Pay (60-day digital twin payment certification), JARVIS Eagle Eye (real-time site monitoring), and JARVIS Assets (predictive ESG lifecycle management)—every module turns fragmented workflows into agentic, executable intelligence.

**We partner with global governments and investors to accelerate nation-scale infrastructure.** 

Through JARVIS Project Management (JPM), we integrate Hong Kong professional services, AI risk prediction, China’s 8,000+ vetted MiC supplier network, and global delivery systems—delivering 20–30% cost savings, 30–45% faster timelines, 71% fewer defects, and 33% shorter cash cycles. In 2025, JPM powered Cameroon’s 28,000-unit housing initiative and Nigeria’s 143-hectare smart city, transforming Belt and Road ambitions into bankable, compliant assets.

**We deploy strategic capital to frontier ConTech and critical infrastructure.**

JARVIS Ventures invests equity, productizes deep tech, and scales via 2,600 live project testbeds and 500 global partners. Project Finance structures transparent digital twin pipelines—unlocking multilateral banks, PE, and commercial lenders with real-time credit ratings and 360° visibility. Together, we de-risk and accelerate AI factories, renewable grids, and urban systems in high-growth economies.

**We ensure safety, carbon efficiency, and resilient infrastructure for humanity.**

Across 2,600 critical assets—data centers, power plants, hospitals, stadiums—we embed 35–45% less waste, 25–35% lower emissions, and predictive health/safety systems. From Hong Kong’s children’s hospitals to Africa’s new government HQs, we build the physical and digital backbone that powers societies—safer, greener, and future-proof.

**Where We Are Going**

Governments, developers, and hyperscalers across APAC and emerging economies are using isBIM to build the AI infrastructure and critical assets that power the next century. With JARVIS, African presidents are signing 28,000-unit housing cities into reality in months—not decades. Data center operators are deploying liquid-cooled AI factories 45% faster, feeding global compute demand. City planners are generating 500,000 sustainable design variants in seconds via JARVIS Air. Contractors are certifying payments in under 60 days, ending 300-day cash chokeholds. Site teams are preventing accidents before they occur with JARVIS SSSS AI wearables. Facility managers are predicting maintenance years ahead, slashing emissions 25–35% and waste 35–45%.

And this is just the beginning.

We are building a future where every infrastructure project is AI-native from day one. Where emerging nations leapfrog legacy construction with Hong Kong precision, China’s MiC scale, and Alibaba-powered intelligence. Where governments deliver national mandates on time, investors underwrite with digital twin certainty, and communities inherit resilient hospitals, clean power grids, and smart cities that serve generations.

This is the operating system for global infrastructure build-out—faster, cheaper, safer, greener.

**Your corporate AI staff for construction — trained on engineering brain, adapts to your culture, automates the tedious.**

_Scroll to Explore_

**The Knowledge Agent: An Engineer’s Brain in AI**

JARVIS Agent is the corporate copilot suite for construction — a living knowledge brain infused with isBIM’s decade of domain expertise and Alibaba’s frontier models. It’s not just automation; it’s your team’s AI staff — always-on agents that carry construction intelligence, learn from your feedback, and evolve to mirror your unique workflows, culture, and standards.

**Three Specialized Agents, One Unified Brain**

- **Email Agent:** CC Agent on any thread — it auto-files documents, extracts data, fills forms, and routes to JARVIS Pay for invoices or VOs. No more lost attachments or manual entry.
- **Compliance Agent:** Ask anytime — “Is this rebar schedule compliant?” or “Does this change order breach scope?” — and get instant, contract- and law-aligned answers with audit trails.
- **Tendering Agent:** Upload a 500-page tender — Agent digests it into bite-sized intel: scoring matrix, BOQ highlights, risk flags, scope gaps. Query it live to stress-test your bid against requirements, freeing your team to focus on strategy, not spreadsheets.

**Train, Interact, Evolve – Your Agent, Your Way**

Every interaction trains the brain. Feedback loops refine accuracy to your corporate DNA — from naming conventions to approval hierarchies. Agent doesn’t just execute — it anticipates, flags anomalies before they escalate, and scales across projects. The result? 80% less admin, faster decisions, and teams doing high-value work.
