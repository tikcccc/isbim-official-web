/**
 * Sanity Client Configuration
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Centralized Sanity client setup with environment-based CDN configuration
 * - Separate clients for read operations (with CDN) and write operations (without CDN)
 * - Type-safe configuration from environment variables
 *
 * CDN Strategy:
 * - Production: Use CDN for read operations (faster, cached)
 * - Development: Bypass CDN for fresh data during development
 * - Write operations: Always bypass CDN for immediate consistency
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```tsx
 * import { client, writeClient } from "@/sanity/lib/client";
 *
 * // Read operations (uses CDN in production)
 * const data = await client.fetch(query);
 *
 * // Write operations (bypasses CDN)
 * await writeClient.create(document);
 * ```
